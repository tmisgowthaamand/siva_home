Cancellation & Refund Policy

Fair, Transparent, and Customer-Friendly

At {Brand}, customer satisfaction is our priority. While we strive to deliver high-quality appliances and services, we understand that cancellations or refunds may occasionally be required. This policy outlines how we handle such requests in a clear and transparent manner.

Order Cancellations

Cancellation Window:
Orders can be cancelled within 2 hours of purchase, provided they have not yet been processed, packed, or dispatched.

Once an order has been shipped or handed over to the courier, cancellations are no longer possible.

To cancel an order, customers must contact our support team with their Order ID.

Returns & Replacements

We accept returns or offer replacements in the following situations:

Product received is damaged in transit.

Wrong item delivered.

Verified manufacturing defects within warranty terms.

Conditions for Returns:

Return requests must be raised within 48 hours of delivery.

The product must be unused, with all original packaging, manuals, and accessories intact.

Installation-based appliances (e.g., ACs, washing machines) must not be uninstalled without authorization from {Brand} or the manufacturer.

Non-Returnable Items

We cannot accept returns/refunds for:

Products damaged due to customer misuse, negligence, or unauthorized installation.

Items without original packaging or invoice.

Opened consumables or accessories (filters, batteries, etc.).

Custom orders or special bulk requests.

Refund Process

Once approved, refunds are initiated within 3–5 business days.

Refunds are processed via the original payment method (UPI, bank transfer, card, etc.).

Depending on the payment provider, refunds may take 5–10 business days to reflect in your account.

In certain cases, refunds may be issued as store credit or replacement based on customer preference.

Warranty & Service Claims

Most appliances come with a manufacturer’s warranty. Warranty claims must be processed directly with the authorized service center.

For installation or service issues handled by {Brand}, customers can reach out to our support team for assistance.

Refunds are not applicable for issues covered under warranty but will be handled through repair/replacement as per manufacturer policy.

Exceptions

Refunds/cancellations are not applicable in cases of:

Delays caused by logistics/courier providers beyond our control.
